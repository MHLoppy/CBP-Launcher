# CBP Launcher
A launcher/installer for the Rise of Nations [Community Balance Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2287791153).

This is still in development, and more features and broader error handling is expected to be added in future versions. Right now it's only expected to work if you *don't* have CBP installed already, but feel free to test it anyway!

Please let me know whether the launcher works / doesn't work for you - the bugs can't get fixed until someone notices them.

### TODO
- Use Steam Workshop files as primary* (target: v0.3)
- Work with existing CBP installs (target: v0.4)
- Remove / archive previous versions of CBP (target: v0.4)
- Launcher can self-update using Steam Workshop files (target v0.5)
- Improved offline capabilities** (target v0.4-v0.6)
- Less.. "everywhere" UI (target v0.4-v0.6)
- Backup then replace default launcher (target v0.5-v0.7)
- Option to override file / registry paths (target v0.4-v0.8)

### Credits
- The basic structure and functionality of the launcher (although an increasing minority of the code) is ported from Tom Weiland's excellent [launcher tutorial](https://github.com/tom-weiland/csharp-game-launcher).
