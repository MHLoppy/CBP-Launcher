# CBP Launcher
A launcher/installer for the Rise of Nations [Community Balance Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2287791153).

*screenshot shows v0.1*

This is still in development, and more updates are ongoing. Versions 3a and below work with CBP Alpha 6c but not if it's already properly installed. Versions 3b and above only target Alpha 7+.

Please let me know whether the launcher works / doesn't work for you - the bugs can't get fixed until someone notices them.

### TODO
- Option to remove previous versions of CBP, instead of archiving (target: v0.5)
- Enable / Disable optional changes (target: v0.5)
- Launcher can self-update using Steam Workshop files (target v0.5)
- Optional changes addressed individually, not as group (target: v0.5-0.6)
- UI overhaul (target v0.5-v0.6)
- Backup then replace default launcher (target v0.5-v0.7)
- Option to override file / registry paths (target v0.5-v0.8)
- Option to load archived versions of CBP (target v0.7-v0.9)
- Load / unload Workshop mod alongside local mod files (wishlist)

### Credits
- The basic structure and functionality of the launcher (although increasingly a minority of the code) is ported from Tom Weiland's excellent [launcher tutorial](https://github.com/tom-weiland/csharp-game-launcher).
