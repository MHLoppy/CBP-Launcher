        originally used for classic plus, but it's slightly easier to keep the same window style, and I don't think it makes it cosmetically worse
    
        Resizing also used to be enabled on Spartan but not ClassicPlus, but easiest to just disable for now
        in future, could re-enable and then save size of each skin (so that resizing spartan doesn't ruin classicplus)-->

        <!-- story time:
        I renamed CurrentView to CurrentSkin
        and used VS' rename function to rename all instances of it..
        except it doesn't rename this one evidently
        so I spent a good hour thinking some of the other code changes I made were causing problems lol -->
